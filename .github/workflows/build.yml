jobs:
  # Job 1: Build and validate the application
  build:
    name: Build Next.js Application
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest  # Use GitHub's Ubuntu runner

    steps:
      # Step 1: Get the code from your repository

      # Step 3: Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci  # ci is faster and more reliable than install

      # Step 4: Run linter to check code quality
      - name: Run ESLint
        run: npm run lint
        continue-on-error: true  # Don't fail the build on lint errors (for now)

      # Step 5: Build the Next.js application

        run: npm run build

      # Step 6: Upload build artifacts (so you can download and inspect them)

  # Job 2: Check for common issues (runs in parallel with build)

# Optional: Add a job for deployment (uncomment when ready)
# deploy:
